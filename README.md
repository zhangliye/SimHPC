# SimHPC

SimHPC is a discrete-event process-oriented simulation framework supporting high-performance computing written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) which is based on the discreate simulation package SimJulia [SimJulia](https://github.com/BenLauwens/SimJulia.jl).

SimHPC aims to support high-performance computing for the simulation, which support distributed and parallel computing on both of single multiple-core machine and clusters.

## Build Status & Coverage
